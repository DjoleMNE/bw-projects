The night is freezing fast,
-+-+-+
To-morrow comes Deber;cember;
-+-+-+-
And winter falls of old
-+-+-+
Are with me from the past;
-+-+-+
And chiefly I rebermember
-+-+-+-
How Dick would hate the cold.
-+-+-+
Fall, winter, fall; for he,
++-+-+
Prompt hand and headpiece er,clever,
++-+-+-
Has woven a winter robe,
-+--+-+
And made of earth and sea
-+-+-+
His overcoat for er,ever,
-+-+-+-
And wears the turning globe.
